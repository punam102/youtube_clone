*Youtube is online platform that allows customer to watch videos online..  *

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;In this project I have tried to make a look alike clone of Youtube. With my efforts and the technology stack, that I have learned till now in  in the masai school, I was able to clone the front end with same looking & features. <br><br>

## Technology Stack Used

- CSS
- JavaScript

For storing user data we also used LocalStorage.

## Libraries Used 🌟
All the image and icon links have been taken from the main website (  https://www.youtube.com/ )

## Snapshots 📷

)


### End Notes 📑
In this project I was tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of javascript & css. This entire journey of has given us experiences and I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence.

### Limitations:
All pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.
(Recomended Resolution: 1366 x 768 )
